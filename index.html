<h2>Welcome to Paintless Dent Solutions!</h2>

<p>
Now when all conditions are satisfied, you can begin to repair the unfortunate dent. First of all, for quality work you need access to the damaged area from the inside, 
it may be technological holes, which are not few in the car, or partial disassembly, such as removal of the fender, lights, door trim, and in some cases 
it is possible additional technological hole drilling, later treated with mauve and closed with a plastic plug. When the preparation of access is finished, it is 
necessary to install the right light, without literate put light, the work better not to start, because if the master can not see the tip of the tool, he most likely 
will work in the wrong place and as a result, spoil the part.

<li>PDR is incredibly fast since no part of your car is removed–usually done in a single day.</li>
<li>Since PDR uses no paint–it has no negative effects on the environment. Meaning it is a great way to keep Denver green!</li>
<li>Almost all paintless dent repair is covered by insurance companies. In fact, many times there is no out of pocket expense for you at all!</li>
